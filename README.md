~10000 IPTV M3U channel list
* Scraping from some large M3U files found elsewhere on the net
* [DOMN:CC] added as suffix to all channel names (listed in alphabetical order by channel name)
* DOMN are 4 letter codes stating which group of servers the channel is coming from (eg: PLTO)
* ZYZX is used as a 4 letter code for small "random" servers that have few (<10) channels
* CC is the 2 letter country code, or "TV" if country code isn't in the original M3U file
* List accessible via: [https://cdgamlin.github.io/IPTV.m3u](https://cdgamlin.github.io/IPTV.m3u)
* Code use to generate list to be released on GitHub (when I get around to it)
