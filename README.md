IPTV M3U channel list containing nearly 10,000 channels
* Scraped and compiled with Python3 from some large M3U files found elsewhere on the net
* Compilation ensures that each URL duplicated across M3U files is occurs only once in the final list
* [DOMN:CC] added as suffix to all channel names
* "DOMN" are 4 letter codes representing which server group the channel is coming from (eg: "PLTO")
* "ZYZX" is used as the 4 letter code for all server groups that have few (currently <10) channels
* "CC" are 2 letter codes representing server country codes (eg: "UK")
* "TV" is used as the 2 letter country code if the country is not determinable from the server URL
* Channels are far from being fully tested - but there are a lot of excellent channels within this list
* List accessible via: [https://cdgamlin.github.io/IPTV.m3u](https://cdgamlin.github.io/IPTV.m3u)
