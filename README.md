IPTV M3U channel list containing nearly 10,000 channels
* Scraping from some large M3U files found elsewhere on the net
* [DOMN:CC] added as suffix to all channel names
* "DOMN" are 4 letter codes stating which group of servers the channel is coming from (eg: "PLTO")
* "ZYZX" is used as the 4 letter code for all small servers that have few (currently <10) channels
* "CC" is the 2 letter country code, or "TV" if country code isn't in the original M3U file
* Channels are far from being fully tested - but there are some great ones in this list of nearly 10,000
* Code use to generate list to be released on GitHub some time (when I get around to it)
* List accessible via: [https://cdgamlin.github.io/IPTV.m3u](https://cdgamlin.github.io/IPTV.m3u)
