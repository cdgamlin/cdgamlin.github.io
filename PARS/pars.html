<h1 id="pars-playlist-aggregator-refiner-scheme-">PARS: <em>Playlist Aggregator Refiner Scheme</em></h1>
<p>Parses multiple FREE online M3U playlists to generate a custom IPTV.M3U playlist</p>
<p>Generated IPTV.M3U channel list currently contains over 18,000 FREE IPTV channels</p>
<ul>
<li>Python3 used for aggregating M3U files found elsewhere on the net (see <a href="https://github.com/cdgamlin/cdgamlin.github.io/tree/main/PARS">source code</a>)</li>
<li>Channel information is parsed from multiple data fields to obtain useful information, such country of origin</li>
<li>Compilation procedure ensures any URL duplicated between M3U files only occurs once in the final file</li>
<li>[DOMN:CC] pattern added as suffix to all channel names, which makes it easier to distinguish between similar channels</li>
<li>&quot;DOMN&quot; are 4 letter codes representing which server group the channel is coming from</li>
<li>&quot;DOMN&quot; 4 letter codes are generated by the algorithm based on the server name (eg: all <a href="https://*.pluto.tv/">https://*.pluto.tv/</a> are &quot;PLTO&quot;)</li>
<li>&quot;CC&quot; are 2 letter codes representing server country codes (eg: &quot;UK&quot;) which can come from server name or group-title info</li>
<li>&quot;TV&quot; is used as the 2 letter country code if the country is not determinable from the server URL or group-title</li>
<li>Channels are grouped into category (where possible) or into subcontinent the channel comes from (when category in unobtainable)</li>
<li>Subcontinents are based more on language groups than geography, to hint what language(s) a channel may be in</li>
<li>Channels are sorted by category, then by title, with subcontinents prefixed with &quot;X:&quot; so they occur after the more descriptive categories</li>
<li>Channels are far from being fully tested, and some links are broken (but there are a lot of excellent channels within this list)</li>
<li>10,000 channels come from two BIG M3U playlists</li>
<li>Other channels come from playlists including: Pluto, Samsung, Plex, Stirr, and country lists from <a href="https://d.tousecurity.com">this site</a></li>
<li>The only countries included from the country list site are: AU, CA, NZ, UK, US</li>
<li>Unless I get some real demand for it, I will not be adding more countries to the list</li>
<li>IPTV.m3u generated playlist is at <a href="https://cdgamlin.github.io/IPTV.m3u">https://cdgamlin.github.io/IPTV.m3u</a></li>
